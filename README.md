# password-generation

a very basic password generation code i made ages ago. i havent checked or improved since the time i finshed it. hopefully there it works as intended and creates passwords and checks with the rockyou.txt file to make sure there isnt any passwords from there being generated.

IMPORTANT:
make sure you have the rockyou.txt password list and a used_password.txt file to read from and write passwords to
(used_passwords.txt file may get automatically created)
